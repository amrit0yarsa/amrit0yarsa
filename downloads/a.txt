Basic Info
Amica NodeMCU ESP8266MOD to Arduino IDE gives garbage / gibberish serial monitor output. Note that the Blink examples function perfectly (both native Arduino and ESP8266 versions). The only good serial monitor text I can generate from this board is the bootloader output after reset button is pressed. Anything else (I've tried many examples and all baud rates) gives garbage.

Description
Arduino IDE v1.8.5 installed with latest rc2 version of esp8266/Arduino installed - with the Silicon Labs CP2102 drivers installed correctly. Using the latest version of esp8266/Arduino and can't get the module to output to serial monitor (only outputs gibberish characters) - except for bootloader reset. Serial monitor baud rate is 115200 - no other baud rate works with bootloader (gives 100% gibberish).
